# ScarCoin Smart Contracts

**Ache-based minting & burn economy for SpiralOS — ScarCoin smart contracts + ScarIndex oracle**

> 📖 **Architecture Reference**: These contracts implement the economic model and governance protocols defined in the [ZoaGrad Mythotech Architecture](https://github.com/ZoaGrad/mythotech-architecture). For complete system design, mathematical specifications, and integration patterns, see the architectural documentation.

## Overview

This repository contains the core smart contracts for the ScarCoin ecosystem, implementing:

*   **Proof-of-Ache tokenomics** with hybrid value measurement
*   **ScarIndex Coherence Oracle** for multi-dimensional system health monitoring
*   **Panic Frames Crisis Protocol** for emergency governance
*   **Three-Branch Governance** system (Witnesses, Judges, Custodians)

## Architecture Integration

The contracts in this repository implement the formal specifications detailed in the [Meta-Architectural Framework](https://github.com/ZoaGrad/mythotech-architecture/blob/main/docs/meta_architectural_framework.md), including:

*   Mathematical formulations for Ache measurement and anti-gaming protocols
*   ScarIndex coherence calculations across narrative, economic, social, and technical dimensions
*   Seven-phase crisis management state machine
*   Sacred gap preservation mechanisms for community-driven emergence

## Development
